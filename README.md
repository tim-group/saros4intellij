saros4intellij
==============

A proof-of-concept spike for porting Saros, the distributed programming tool for Eclipse, to IntelliJ. Using Eclipse on one side, and Eclipse + IntelliJ on the other, you can just about share some editing and file open events.

Relies on:
 - a forked version of Saros here: https://github.com/youdevise/dpp-saros
 - an http client/server here: https://github.com/youdevise/saros-via-http
